# Azure Resource Manager introduction to DSC

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to author a Desired State Configuration using Powershell DSC.  This lab will also cover applying DSC to a virtual machine using virtual machine extensions, how to verify DSC has been applied successfully, and how to troubleshoot DSC.

## Exercise 1: Create Powershell Desired State Configuration

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you will create a powershell Desired State Configuration (DSC) and apply the configuration manually.

### Task 1: Write an HTML file

1. In your root folder, create a folder named `test`.

2. In a text editor, type the following text:

```html
<head></head>
<body>
<p>Hello World!</p>
</body>
```

3. Save this as `index.htm` in the `test` folder you created earlier.

### Task 2: Write the configuration

1. In the VM created in the 'Before hands on lab...' open PowerShell ISE and type the following:

```powershell
Configuration WebsiteTest {

    # Import the module that contains the resources we're using.
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName PsDesiredStateConfiguration

    # The Node statement specifies which targets this configuration will be applied to.
    Node 'localhost' {

        # The first resource block ensures that the Web-Server (IIS) feature is enabled.
        WindowsFeature WebServer {
            Ensure = "Present"
            Name   = "Web-Server"
        }

        # The second resource block ensures that the website content copied to the website root folder.
        File WebsiteContent {
            Ensure = 'Present'
            SourcePath = 'c:\test\index.htm'
            DestinationPath = 'c:\inetpub\wwwroot'
        }
    }
}
```

2. Save the file as `WebsiteTest.ps1`.

### Task 3: Compile the configuration

1. To compile the configuration, run WebsiteTest.ps1.  This places the function in a global scope
```powershell
PS C:\ConfigurationTest>. .\WebsiteTest.ps1
```
2. Next, run the function by entering it's name.  The output will be a MOF file
```powershell
PS C:\ConfigurationTest>WebsiteTest
Directory: C:\ConfigurationTest\WebsiteTest
Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name                                                              
----                -------------         ------ ----                                                              
-a----        7/24/2018  11:58 PM           2756 localhost.mof  
```

### Task 4: Apply the configuration and verify status

1. Apply the configuraiton by running the following command:
```powershell
PS C:\ConfigurationTest> Start-DscConfiguration .\WebsiteTest
```
2. It will take a few minutes for the configuration to apply.  Get the status of the configuration by running the following command.
```powershell
Get-DscConfigurationStatus
```
3. Once the status shows 'Success', browse to http://locahost 

4. Alternatively, DSC status can be retrieved by examining the Windows Event Viewer. DSC events are in: Applications and Services Logs/Microsoft/Windows/Desired State Configuration.

### Task 5: Cleanup
The local DSC configuration will be removed so that it can be applied through Azure VM extensions in Exercise 2.
1. In PowerShell, run the following command:
```powershell
Remove-DscConfigurationDocument -Stage Current
```
2. The previous step removed the .mof document.  The individual server configuration must still be reverted.  To do this, run the following command:
```powershell
Uninstall-WindowsFeature Web-Server
