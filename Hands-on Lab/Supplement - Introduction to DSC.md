# Azure Resource Manager introduction to DSC

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to author a Desired State Configuration using Powershell DSC.  This lab will also cover applying DSC to a virtual machine using virtual machine extensions, how to verify DSC has been applied successfully, and how to troubleshoot DSC.

## Exercise 1: Create Powershell Desired State Configuration

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you will create a powershell Desired State Configuration (DSC) and apply the configuration manually.

### Task 1: Write an HTML file

1. Create the HTML file that we will use as the website content:

In your root folder, create a folder named `test`.

In a text editor, type the following text:

```html
<head></head>
<body>
<p>Hello World!</p>
</body>
```

Save this as `index.htm` in the `test` folder you created earlier.

### Task 2: Write the configuration

1. In the VM created in the 'Before hands on lab...' open PowerShell ISE and type the following:
```powershell
Configuration WebsiteTest {

    # Import the module that contains the resources we're using.
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName PsDesiredStateConfiguration

    # The Node statement specifies which targets this configuration will be applied to.
    Node 'localhost' {

        # The first resource block ensures that the Web-Server (IIS) feature is enabled.
        WindowsFeature WebServer {
            Ensure = "Present"
            Name   = "Web-Server"
        }

        # The second resource block ensures that the website content copied to the website root folder.
        File WebsiteContent {
            Ensure = 'Present'
            SourcePath = 'c:\test\index.htm'
            DestinationPath = 'c:\inetpub\wwwroot'
        }
    }
}
```

Save the file as `WebsiteTest.ps1`.
