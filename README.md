# Abstract

## Workshop
In this workshop, students will help a global publisher architect a
solution to migrate their on-premises procurement system into Azure.
Because of the desire to not change the existing application, this will
involve moving the application and its dependencies onto Azure IaaS VMs.
There are many questions and concerns the customer has, and they will
look to the student to answer these and provide the end-state design and
the high-level steps to get there.

Attendees will be better able to migrate and enable easy deployment for
lift and shift capabilities. In addition, attendees will learn to:

-   Build and deploy complex infrastructure solutions with Azure
    Resource Manager templates

-   Work with Azure Automation Desired State Configuration (DSC) for
    deploying server configurations

-   Scale existing templatized deployments leveraging VM Scale Sets
